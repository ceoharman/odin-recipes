    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The actual noodles pictured above were my dinner last night, albeit I was a little heavy handed with a big dollop of chilli sauce that had me gasping and sweating (and swearing) through every bite.</p>
    <p>Don't fear, it was self inflicted torture. those red strips you see are capsicum/bell peppers, not chilli. there is no sign of chilli in this recipe</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>capsicum/bell peppers</li>
      <li>carrot</li>
      <li>onion garlic</li>
      <li>chicken</li>
      <li>green onion</li>
      <li>egg noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Be prepared! As with all stir fries and noodles, have everything chopped and ready to toss straight in because once you start cooking, it moves FAST! You’ll be done 5 – 6 minutes.</li>
      <li>Double duty sauce – whatever protein you use, season it with some of the Sauce before cooking. Makes it extra tasty!</li>
      <li>TWO wooden spoons will make your tossing life a whole lot easier</li>
      <li>Wok or skillet – you don’t have to cook stir fries in a wok, but it does make it easier to toss enthusiastically, as is called for with stir fries. If you don’t have a wok, just use a very large skillet, preferably one heavy based that holds heat well.</li>
      <li>Keep things MOVING! Once you start cooking, keep stirring for the whole time otherwise things will start stewing i.e. leeching liquid. This will make your vegetables soggy and your noodles watery.</li>
      <li>CRISP tender vegetables – all stir fries and noodles are supposed to have “crisp tender” vegetables, meaning the vegetables are just cooked but are still a tiny bit raw inside. This not only retains their flavour, colour and nutrients better, but also is integral to the dish because overcooked vegetables leech water which waters down the flavour of the sauce.</li>
