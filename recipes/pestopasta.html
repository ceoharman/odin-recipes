    <p>The first snow came early in Chicago this year. It was barely November and we were driving to an appointment. It was snowing, and then all of a sudden it went from “really charming” to “wow it’s really coming down!” We sat in the cold car way too long, wearing way too-light coats, staring at brake lights and a grey sky. I thought – really – what have we done?? I write a blog about vegetables, I’m shooting a book that’s due before May (when the spring farmers markets open) and we’ve moved so far from the sun!</p>
    <p>We got to where we were going – an industrial area in the Pullman neighborhood where, situated on the roof of the Method production facility, is Gotham Greens. I’ve been obsessed with their locally grown greens since the moment I came across their deliciously spicy arugula earlier this year. We got a tour of their rooftop greenhouse, and even though it was cold and miserable outside, it was so warm and sunny up there. There was a sea of the softest butter lettuces, my favorite spicy arugula, and the loveliest scent of fresh basil.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pesto sauce</li>
      <li>Pasta</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Blend up a batch of my 6-ingredient basil pesto, or use store-bought pesto in a pinch.</li>
      <li>Cook your pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package directions.</li>
      <li>Before draining the pasta, reserve some of the starchy pasta water. Then, add 1/4 cup of this pasta water back into the pot with your pesto, and stir to thin the pesto.</li>
      <li>Toss in the cooked pasta, and mix until the pesto thoroughly coats it.</li>
      <li>Add a big handful of arugula and toss until it’s barely wilted.</li>
      <li>Finish everything with a big squeeze of lemon, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and toasted pine nuts.</li>
    </ol>
